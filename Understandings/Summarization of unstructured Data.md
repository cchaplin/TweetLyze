------------------------------------------
###Findings:

Brief Paper on summarization of unstructured data:
[http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/paper/ispn.pdf](http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/paper/ispn.pdf "Summarization of unstructred data")
	
	What this paper talks about is how we can use clustering , ranking of these clusters
	to find the right ones to use for summarization. We can also use measures like
	co-occurence to derive the summary.

### Fields i need from the tweet:

	Text,geo,source,created_at - I think for basic analysis this is sufficient.

###Things to do:
	
	
	1) Should i use search / streaming api? Using search api.
	2) Use postgres to store raw data and processed data
	3) Finish the whole pipline of consumer pool , executors and threads.
